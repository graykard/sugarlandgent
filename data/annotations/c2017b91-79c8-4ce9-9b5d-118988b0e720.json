After all, my hometown has started changing rather quickly. I mean really quickly. In the past ten years, the city of Houston has seen quite the jump in prices... housing, rent, etc. So, it makes sense that people are looking to move away from the city, and find something more reasonable. Some of them go to Sugar Land, TX. On the one hand, that sounds like growth—more people, more buildings, more jobs, more hospitals, more lanes on the freeway. But on the other maybe not... because behind all of this growth is a word that has become somewhat more common in and around cities alike, gentrification."

Other cities have come up with better ways to deal with this. There are ways. So, let's discuss a few of these that could work in Sugar Land. First, inclusionary zoning. This is when developers are required to provide a percentage of new housing as affordable. So yes, build that new apartment complex *but make part of it affordable to people already living in this area.* The second solution is community land trusts. These, nonprofit organizations buy land and then keep the land forever for affordable housing. This way, the land truly stays in the community and housing prices don't go way up. \n"

It is about creating stability and power for renters in a market that is frequently hostile, if not completely one-sided, against them.These are not just concepts: they have been shown to work. One example is Columbia Heights in Washington D.C. A historically African American area and adjacent to Howard University. Columbia Heights experienced extreme disinvestment and damage from the MLK riots, which led to City intervention with renewed investment into the area, with several caveats. In contrast to the former issues with rent disinvestment and tenant displacement, the new investment will incorporate incorporate 1) An additional subway stop, 2) units of affordable housing, and 3) funding for nonprofits to develop affordable housing. To this day, Columbia Heights has kept 20% of housing affordable and former tenants now own their own buildings with tenant protections keeping tenants stable amidst the intensifying growth.\n"

Yes, those are legitimate concerns. But what is most important—profits or people?Because when push comes to shove, we are talking about people being pushed away from their communities. Their schools. Their churches. Their memories. Their stories. That isn't \"progress\"; that is loss.So, imagine watching the neighbourhood you live in disappear in front of your eyes.
